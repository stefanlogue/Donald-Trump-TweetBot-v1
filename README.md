# Donald-Trump-TweetBot-v1
Python script for replying to reddit comments about Trump with Trump Tweets


Created as a social experiment to see how users across various subreddits would react to actual tweets from Trump.

*Should be noted that the tweets were not preselected, and were in fact chosen completely at random by the bot.*

No subreddits were targetted in particular, the only targets were comments where the words 'Donald' or 'Trump' were included. This was to stop comments from going on *completely* unrelated threads, where it would be seen more as spamming than anything else.

If you are going to use this code, please do so under Reddit's guidelines, and I will not be held responsible for anything you do with the code.
